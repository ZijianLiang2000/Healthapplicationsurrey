<h2>Who shouldn't use a BMI calculator
<p>BMI is not used for muscle builders, long distance athletes, pregnant women, the elderly or young children.
This is because BMI does not take into account whether the weight is carried as muscle or fat, just the number. 
Those with a higher muscle mass, such as athletes, may have a high BMI but not be at greater health risk. 
Those with a lower muscle mass, such as children who have not completed their growth or the elderly who may be 
losing some muscle mass may have a lower BMI. During pregnancy and lactation, a woman's body composition changes,
so using BMI is not appropriate. For more information, visit <%= link_to "Health Canada's Canadian Guidelines for Body Weight Classification in Adults", "https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/healthy-weights/canadian-guidelines-body-weight-classification-adults/body-mass-index-nomogram.html", target: :_blank%>.

<h2>Limitations of the BMI
<p>Your BMI can tell you if you're carrying too much weight, but it cannot tell if you're carrying too much fat.
The BMI cannot tell the difference between excess fat, muscle or bone.
The adult BMI does not take into account age, gender or muscle mass.
<p>This means:
<p>very muscular adults and athletes may be classed "overweight" or "obese" even though their body fat is low
adults who lose muscle as they get older may fall into the "healthy weight" range even though they may be carrying excess fat
Pregnancy will also affect a woman's BMI result. Your BMI will go up as your weight increases. You should use your pre-pregnancy weight when calculating your BMI.

Apart from these limitations, the BMI is a relatively straightforward and convenient way of assessing someone's weight.

Eating disorders
If you have an eating disorder, the BMI calculator results do not apply. Please get further advice from a GP.
